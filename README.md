My personal website showcasing some of the recent projects I've worked on.

Using jquery parallax (http://stephband.info/jparallax/) to create an awesome parallax effect relative to the cursor's position on the screen. This effect also works on mobile devices by detecting the tilt of the device but I disabled it since it was too resource hungry.
